function [ destination_Image ] = apply_H( original_Image , H , siz )
%apply_H Performs a specific homography to a given image
%   Inpunt:
%       -Original Image: Image to be transformed
%       -H: matrix 3x3 which defines the homography
%       -siz: size of the destination image
%
%   Output:
%       -Destination Image: Image after homography
%       -First the destination image size is computed from the four
%       external points transformed.
%       -Then, a transformation is made so the points do not fall outside
%       the border.
%       -Afterwards, the points are draw on its place.
